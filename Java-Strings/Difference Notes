************************************ STRINGS **********************************************

1. Difference b/w String And String Builder Or String Buffer
- String are immutable objects where as 
String builder gives mutable 
- String methods needs to be referenced for modification where as
String builder doesn't need as it updates internally
- String consumes more memory because literal will stay in memory where as
String Builder doesn't as string object keeps updating
- String doesn't support useful methods such as insert, delete etc.. where as
String builder supports the same

2. Difference b/w String Builder And String Buffer
- String Builder is single threaded where as
String Buffer is multi threaded
- String Builder performance is high where as 
String Buffer is low as methods are synchronized
- String Builder methods are NOT synchronized in nature where as
String Buffer method are synchronized

3. Difference b/w String constant pool & Heap
> It is special memory of heap which stores the string objects which are unique where as
for heap it creates objects without any uniqueness
> Any string object is checked against string constant pool if created as literal where as
for heap it will create object every time
> String objects in pool wont be destroyed where as
string objects will be garbage collected post usage
