- It is not thread-safe by nature. 
- "CopyOnWriteArrayList", Atomic Arrays is used for thread-safe operations

> Creation

  - var arr = {1,2,3} <br>
- It can be created with 'new' keyword
	- new Integer[];
	- new Integer[] {1,2,3} ---- with literal

> Methods
- length - returns the length of the array

> Advantage
- It stores collection of data
- It can store primitive and objects
